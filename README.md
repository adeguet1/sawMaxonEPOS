# sawMaxonEPOS

This SAW component contains code for interfacing with Maxon EPOS controllers.

The `ros` folder contains code for a ROS node that interfaces with the sawMaxonEPOS component.

If needed, one can also add OpenIGTLink support using sawOpenIGTLink (contact the sawMaxonEPOS developers if you need help with this).

Please note, per Maxon, this USB interface is not intended for realtime applications.

# Dependencies
 * cisst libraries: https://github.com/jhu-cisst/cisst
 * Qt for user interface
 * ROS (optional)
 * Maxon EPOS Driver

## Install Maxon Drivers (Linux)
You can download the Maxon Linux Library from the Maxon Website.

```bash
cd /tmp
wget https://www.maxongroup.ch/medias/sys_master/root/8994700394526/EPOS-Linux-Library-En.zip
unzip EPOS-Linux-Library-En.zip
cd EPOS_Linux_Library/
sudo bash EPOS_Linux_Library/install.sh
rm -rf /tmp/EPOS-Linux-Library-En.zip /tmp/EPOS_Linux_Library
```

Upon successful installation, you should see:

EPOS Command Library [Version Number] installed
# Build

You can find some documentation re. compiling cisst and SAW components in the [dVRK wiki](https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/sawIntuitiveResearchKit/wiki/CatkinBuild#catkin-build-and-rosinstall)(best source if you're using Linux with ROS) and the [cisst wiki](https://github.com/jhu-cisst/cisst/wiki/Compiling-cisst-and-SAW-with-CMake)(more details and provides instructions for Windows as well).

If you see that the EPOS_INCLUDE_DIR is not found, you might be using a newer version of the EPOS library. If you want to use this newer version, place the version number into the ```set (KNOWN_VERSIONS 6.6.2.0 6.8.1.0)``` line in the CMakeLists.txt file in ```components```. 


<!-- For Linux with ROS, we provide a rosinstall file to retrieve all the git repositories you need for sawMaxonEPOS:
```

# Running the examples

## Linux permissions

Maxon EPOS uses a serial port to communicate.  When connecting the device to your computer, a pseudo device will be added to the `/dev` directory. Â  Usually something like `/dev/ttyS01`, `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`.  Using the command `dmesg` can help identify which device is used.  Check the file permissions on said device, e.g.,
```sh
ls -al /dev/ttyUSB0
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 188, 0 Jan  3 09:32 /dev/ttyUSB0
```
On Ubuntu, the OS usually sets the ownership of `/dev/ttyUSB0` to `root` and the group to `dialout`.   To grant permissions to read and write to the device, use the command `sudo adduser <user_id> dialout` to add users to the `dialout` group.   Please note that the user has to logout/login for the new group membership to take effect.
